						desc: `With sparse stacktrace, I was able to improve debugging in release environment,
					 by adding various debug trackers (opened windows, bug count). With new system we could focus on the most important bugs first. 
					Number of exceptions was decreasing greatly in consequent releases.
					`}, {
						title: "Proposed a workaround for browser related bug",
						desc: `There was a bug which prevented playing game in Chrome browser. 
					After some research I found that turning of "hardware acceleration" was also disabling webgl and consequently producing black screen. I proposed a workaround: 
					detecting if browser can use webgl and show appropiate message to the user.`}, {
						title: "Delegating work to younger coworkers",
						desc: `I delegated work to younger and less experienced coworkers with tips how they can solve the problem. I was also supervising their progress and give them hints if they seemed stuck. I reviewed their work and gave them feedback on code quality.`
					}, {
						title: "Improving overall system reliabilty",
						desc: `I improved system stability by implementing few helper extension methods. C# main pain points are Null Exception and Out of Range exceptions. I borrowed few concepts from Rust (iterating, options) and implemented similar functions in C#. In result, code became more reliable, and in lot of cases shorter and easier to read. For example, I implemented .IterateWithIndex function, which is similar to foreach loop but with additional index passing. It is safer than for loop and easier to write.`

						title: "Developing network error handling system",
						desc: `Designed workaround for failing to download assets and proposed which assets should have retry option and which not. Improved overall reliability and user experience.`

					}, {
						title: "Fixed difficult bug appearing only in webgl build",
						desc: `After some testing I discovered that too many requests (at the same time) to asset bundle manager was making game crash, but only on webgl. Implemented request queue and fixed the problem.`
					}, {
						title: "Improved in-house library",
						desc: `Sent bug reports and improvement plans for in-house library`

						title: "Created useful tools",

						title: "Improved performance of list and fixed bugs in the implementation (Unity)",
						desc: `Reusing elements for long lists is a way to create long lists faster, but it is not enough to reuse the elements. I improved performance by implementing request queue and introduced new canceling implementation. I also found a bug which was caused by autounloading the icon textures from asset bundle. I also implemented custom reference counting for unloading textures.`
