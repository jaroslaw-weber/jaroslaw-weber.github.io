						My name is Jaroslaw Weber, and I’m a developer from Poland with 5 years of experience in mobile game development. 
						I have worked on games being played by over 80 000 users. 
						I was one of the main developer and am often being assigned to implementing new features from scratch.
						<br><br>
						My goal as a programmer is to increase quality of the product. Documentation I wrote for the core parts of the application allowed new developers on the team to transition more smoothly.
						Bug report system I have implemented helped detect bugs early and assured smooth release without major bugs.
My file dependency tweaks resulted in download size decrease from 3mb to 100kb. 
I have implemented optimization (in one part of the game) that resulted in about 10 times better performance and eliminated screen freezing.
<br><br>
						Last few years I spend in Asia, working both on my programming and language skills.
Currently living in Tokyo and working at DMM GAMES.
						Found more about me below and contact me if you are interested. You can contact me in English, Japanese or Polish since I can speak those 3 languages fluently.`
