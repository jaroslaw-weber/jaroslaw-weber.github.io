						title: "Delegating work to younger coworkers",

					}, {
						title: "Improving overall system reliabilty",
						desc: `I improved system stability by implementing few helper extension methods. C# main pain points are Null Exception and Out of Range exceptions. I borrowed few concepts from Rust (iterating, options) and implemented similar functions in C#. In result, code became more reliable, and in lot of cases shorter and easier to read. For example, I implemented .IterateWithIndex function, which is similar to foreach loop but with additional index passing. It is safer than for loop and easier to write.`

I improved performance by implementing request queue and introduced new canceling implementation. I also found a bug which was caused by autounloading the icon textures from asset bundle. I also implemented custom reference counting for unloading textures.`
